logistic regression

discrete either true or false only two outputs will be given
values.reshape(-1,-1)
1d-->2d

support vector machine(svm)
divides postive and negative hyperplane by a line(max margin)

:a point  which is closer to hyperplane are the "support vectors" on both sides
outlayers

kernal is used to convert to higher dimension until it is "linearly separable"

hyperplane equation:
w.x+b=0
w=classified vaectors (weight vector)
x=input
b-bias term

max margin:
margin=2/||w||
